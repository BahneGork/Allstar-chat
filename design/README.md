# Design Files

This folder contains source design files for AllStar assets.

## Icon Files

- **icon.afdesign** - Affinity Designer source file for the app icon
  - Export as `icon.ico` (256x256) to `../assets/icon.ico`
  - Export as `icon.png` (512x512) to `../assets/icon.png`

## Workflow

1. Edit `icon.afdesign` in Affinity Designer
2. Export to `assets/` folder
3. Commit both source and exported files
4. Push to git

This way the source files are always backed up and versioned!
